# Game2 Automation Python

This project aims to develop a game bot using Python, specifically utilizing the PyAutoGUI and OpenCV libraries, to automate tasks and achieve optimal performance in the game "Game2". By leveraging computer vision and input simulation techniques, this bot will be capable of interacting with the game's user interface and executing various actions with high precision and efficiency.

## Features

- **Automation**: The bot will automate repetitive tasks in the game, such as navigating menus, performing specific actions, and completing various game objectives.
- **Computer Vision**: Utilizing OpenCV, the bot will employ image recognition techniques to identify and locate specific elements on the game screen, enabling it to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.
- **Input Simulation**: By leveraging PyAutoGUI, the bot will simulate mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs to interact with the game interface and control the character within the game.
- **Customization**: The project will allow for easy configuration and customization of the bot's behavior through adjustable parameters and settings, enabling users to adapt the bot to different gameplay scenarios.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- PyAutoGUI library (version 0.9.50 or higher)
- OpenCV library (version 4.5.3 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
- **git clone https://github.com/onurcangnc/game2_automation_python**
2. Navigate to the project directory:
- **cd game2_automation_python**
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
- **pip install -r requirements.txt**

## Usage

1. Launch the game "Game2" and ensure that the game window is visible on your screen.

2. Open the main script file, `cookieClicker.py`, in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

3. Customize the bot's behavior by adjusting the configurable parameters within the script, such as image recognition thresholds, input delays, or game-specific coordinates.

4. Save the changes made to the `cookieClicker.py` script.

5. Execute the script to start the game bot: python cookieClicker.py
